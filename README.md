# LucidNightmareNavigator
Addon that keeps track of the wacky maze ("The Endless Halls") required for the Lucid Nightmare mount.

This addon automatically draws out a pretty useless map as you're running around, but it also keeps track of everywhere you run,
and it can give you turn-by-turn navigation directions back to a point of interest or the nearest unexplored territory.  Just hit
the "wall" buttons at the top of the addon to mark which cardinal directions are impassible, and let the addon guide you to glory!

There's also a way to export your map in-progress to a text box in the bottom left corner (and import it from the text box).  I'd 
recommend periodically doing this in case the map gets fouled up, but it's not a huge deal.

Warning: This addon doesn't gracefully handle the "teleport trap" square.  If you use the addon to try and map out the whole maze
before grabbing any orbs and depositing them on any runes, the map will probably foul itself up and mislead you a little.  Sorry..

If someone's up to speed on their graph theory and has a good way to deal with the trap properly, post about it on the "Issues"
section on https://github.com/Debuggernaut/LucidNightmareNavigator/issues and I'll implement it when I get a chance
